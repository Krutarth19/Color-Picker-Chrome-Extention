# Color-Picker-Chrome-Extention
This is a simple Chrome extension that allows you to pick a color from any webpage and copy its hexadecimal value       to the clipboard. It uses the Chrome storage API to save the selected color, and the Chrome scripting API to inject a content script into the active tab and retrieve the selected color.
